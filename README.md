# Polygon qualities

**Overview**

This repository contains Java code and documentation for performing simple analyses on given parameters for a specific shape. Within this project, there exists multiple different "setter" classes that each represent a different 2D shape--Point, LineSegment. Each of these classes have their own instance variables that are used in the two calculation classes--Rectangle, and RegularPentagon.

Rectangle and RegularPentagon utilize the parameters and instance variables from the "setter" classes to find different characteristics about their respective shapes, notably area and perimeter.

The Polygon class compiles all of the created Rectangle and/or RegularPentagon shapes into an accessible array.

The Main class consists of debugging and tests.
